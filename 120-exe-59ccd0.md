120.exe is the executable file associated with the Free FLV to MP4 Converter software developed by T7R Studio, specifically version 9.2.80.0, which is designed to convert FLV video files into MP4 format. While the application itself is generally considered safe and has been used by many users for video conversion, it's important to note that any executable file can potentially be a vector for malware if it has been tampered with or downloaded from untrustworthy sources. Users should ensure that they download the software from the official T7R Studio website or reputable download platforms to minimize the risk of encountering viruses or unwanted software. Occasionally, users may experience errors related to 120.exe, such as issues with file conversion, application crashes, or compatibility problems with certain video formats, which may require troubleshooting or updates to resolve. Overall, while 120.exe is not inherently malicious, caution should always be exercised when dealing with executable files and software installations.
